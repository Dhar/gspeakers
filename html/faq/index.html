<b>FAQ</b><br>
<i>Why does not gspeakers display any text in the plot? I also get a lot of error
messages in the console.</i><br>
You probably have gspeakers configured to use a font which does not exist on your
system. Open preferences dialog and select a font.<br>
<i>GSpeakers crashes upon startup, what is wrong?</i><br>
There might be an error in the config-file. Try "mv ~/.gspeakers ~/.gspeakers.bak" and
restart gspeakers. There might also be a problem if you specified a "pkgdatadir"
different from "[prefix]/share/gspeakers" (where [prefix] is the prefix specified when
you ran ./configure).<br>&nbsp;<br>
