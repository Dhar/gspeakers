GSpeakers TODO-list
-------------------

1) The tasks does not appear in any specific order. If you want more 
    information about the tasks, mail dss@home.se

2) Tasks that should be done before 1.0 is marked "pre 1.0"

3) For more information about the GSpeakers roadmap, visit
    http://gspeakers.sf.net/needhelp.html

* Translations

* Rpm, deb and tgz binary packages, i will need maintainer for different 
    packages too (pre-1.0)

* Windows installer (maybe pre-1.0)

* Loudspeaker design with GSpeakers HOWTO (important, will increase user 
    base, pre-1.0)

* Make id_string cell in CrossoverHistory editable (pre 1.0)

* CrossoverTreeView: remove code for changing the unit for a part (pre 1.0)

* Translate documentation

* Make GSpeakersPlot (gspeakersplot.h/cc) handle >20k x-values, also improve 
    this class and make it more general

* Optimize the order the colors appear in GSpeakersColor.cc/h (an easy task 
    but it requires some thinking), consecutive colors coming out of 
    GSpeakersColor should not be similar, the colors should also be clear and 
    easy to distinguish from each other, use the 32 Basic Gnome colors

* Better icons in the main window notebook

* Evolution/MrProject "notebook" instead of GtkNotebook

* Better program icon

* Install icon to gnome menus (pre 1.0)

* Add tooltips to appropriate widgets (pre 1.0)

* FilterLinkFrame: only recalc affected part values

* Check that the spice executable selected in setting dialog really is a 
    valid spice-program (maybe pre 1.0)

* Maybe we should remove the need for an external SPICE-interpreter...or call 
    a SPICE-interpreter from a lib or something like that

* Clean up temp dir after SPICE execution (pre 1.0)

* SpeakerEditor: select next (or previous) listitem on remove, you should be 
    able to undo "delete driver" (important)

* SpeakerEditor: code cleanup

* SpeakerEditor: cache SPICE calculations and file reads (may be important on 
    slow systems)

* Add "autoupdate SPICE calculations" on drivers tab too (maybe pre 1.0)

* UI should look the same on each tab and follow Gnome HIG (most of this is 
    done, pre 1.0)

* Support nonmetric units

* Splash screen, since loading the program takes a little while

* Make GSpeakers work on 640x480 (pre 1.0)

* Tune GSpeakersPlot so that it works with default screen font (maybe pre 1.0)

* Drag'n'drop reorder listviews

* Tree with woofer/midrange/tweeter in driver list, will make it easier if we 
    we have a lot of drivers, this should be configurable

* show/edit Q for a sealed enclosure (pre 1.0)

* Meassurement tab

* Calculate enclosure dimensions

* Recommended freq range in driver tab

* Phase response on crossover tab

* Crossover edit redesign

* Native KDE, Windows and MacOSX (file) dialogs

* Ask if you want to continue when saving over a file

* Maybe do something about "delete plot icon"?
