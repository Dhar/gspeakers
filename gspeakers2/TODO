GSpeakers TODO-list
-------------------

1) The tasks does not appear in any specific order. If you want more information 
about the tasks, mail dss@home.se

2) Some tasks may be more important than others, some are important due to 
the structure in the program, some are important due to the UI experience.

* Remove all glib-stuff from part.cc, net.cc, crossover.cc, speaker.cc, 
    speakerlist.cc, box.cc and boxlist.cc

* Find out how to right adjust text in labels attached to a table (for example
    in the SpeakerEditor)

* Icons on the buttons in various dialogs

* Add "insert_column_with_data_func();" to various columns in treeviews, for 
    example: enclosure types
     
    -Print less decimals in box- and speakereditor treeview, and everywhere else 
     we print decimal numbers

    -Change type field in speakereditor treeview to some text instead of the 
     current integer

* Rpm, deb and tgz binary packages, i will need maintainer for different 
    packages too (important)

* Compile and run on windows and docs for this (important) 

* Windows installer

* Speakereditor and CrossoverHistory: ask if you want to save changes 
    when open new xml

* Loudspeaker design with GSpeakers HOWTO (important)

* All dialogs and windows should save its size and position 
    (use global settings, see common.h)

* Make id_string cell in CrossoverHistory editable

* CrossoverTreeView: remove code for changing the unit for a part

* Clear up and maybe rewrite BoxEditor

* Internationalization, get_text support and more

* Translate documentation

* Make GSpeakersPlot (gspeakersplot.h/cc) handle >20k x-values

* Optimize the order the colors appear in GSpeakersColor.cc/h (an easy task 
    but it requires some thinking), consecutive colors coming out of 
    GSpeakersColor should not be similar, the colors should also be clear and 
    easy to distinguish (<-howto spell???) from each other

* Reorder some columns in the treeviews to improve the user experience

* Icons for the notebooks in the main window

* Program icon for the main window

* Add tooltips to appropriate widgets

* Add try/catch on xml files loaded in ctors

* FilterLinkFrame: only recalc affected part values

* Check that the spice executable selected in setting dialog really is a 
    valid spice-program

* Maybe we should remove the need for an external SPICE-interpreter...or call 
    a SPICE-interpreter from a lib or something like that

* Clean up temp dir after SPICE execution
