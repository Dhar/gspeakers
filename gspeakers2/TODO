GSpeakers TODO-list
-------------------

1) The tasks does not appear in any specific order. If you want more information 
about the tasks, mail dss@home.se

2) Some tasks may be more important than others, some are important due to 
the structure in the program, some are important due to the UI experience.

* Remove all glib-stuff from part.cc, net.cc, crossover.cc, speaker.cc, 
    speakerlist.cc, box.cc and boxlist.cc

* Find out how to right adjust text in labels attached to a table (for example
    in the SpeakerEditor)

* Icons on the buttons in various dialogs, maybe switch to toolbars...

* Add "insert_column_with_data_func();" to various columns in treeviews, for 
    example: enclosure types (important for the user experience)
     
    -Print less decimals in box- and speakereditor treeview, and everywhere else 
     we print decimal numbers

    -Change type field in speakereditor treeview to some text instead of the 
     current integer

* Rpm, deb and tgz binary packages, i will need maintainer for different 
    packages too (important)

* Compile and run on windows and docs for this (important) 

* Windows installer

* Speakereditor and CrossoverHistory: ask if you want to save changes 
    when open new xml (important)

* Loudspeaker design with GSpeakers HOWTO (important, will increase user base)

* Make id_string cell in CrossoverHistory editable

* CrossoverTreeView: remove code for changing the unit for a part

* Clear up and maybe rewrite BoxEditor

* Box xml should save driver (important)

* Rewrite boxhistory and boxplot history, make it more intuitive to 
    use (important)

* Internationalization, get_text support and more

* Translate documentation

* Make GSpeakersPlot (gspeakersplot.h/cc) handle >20k x-values, also improve 
    this class and make it more general

* Optimize the order the colors appear in GSpeakersColor.cc/h (an easy task 
    but it requires some thinking), consecutive colors coming out of 
    GSpeakersColor should not be similar, the colors should also be clear and 
    easy to distinguish from each other, use the 32 Basic Gnome colors

* Reorder some columns in the treeviews to improve the user experience

* Better icons in the main window notebook

* Better program icon, install icon to gnome menus...

* Add tooltips to appropriate widgets

* Add try/catch on xml files loaded in ctors

* FilterLinkFrame: only recalc affected part values

* Check that the spice executable selected in setting dialog really is a 
    valid spice-program

* Maybe we should remove the need for an external SPICE-interpreter...or call 
    a SPICE-interpreter from a lib or something like that

* Clean up temp dir after SPICE execution

* SpeakerEditor: select next (or previous) listitem on remove, you should be 
    able to undo "delete driver"

* SpeakerEditor: code cleanup

* SpeakerEditor: cache SPICE calculations and file reads (may be important on 
    slow systems)

* Add "autoupdate SPICE calculations" on drivers tab too

* UI should look the same on each tab

* Support nonmetric units

* Config option: view all toolbars, view toolbars independently 
    from each other

* Settings dialog should apply changes "on the fly"

* GSpeakers should ask if you want to save changes

* Maybe a configurable (on/off) splash screen, since loading the program takes 
    a little while

* GSpeakers should ask if you want to save changed upon quit

* Make GSpeakers work on 640x480

* Tune GSpeakersPlot so that it works with default screen font
