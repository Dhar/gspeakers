GSpeakers TODO-list
-------------------

1) The tasks does not appear in any specific order. If you want more information 
about the tasks, mail dss@home.se

2) Some tasks may be more important than others, some are important due to 
the structure in the program, some are important due to the UI experience.

* Remove all glib-stuff from part.cc, net.cc, crossover.cc, speaker.cc, 
    speakerlist.cc, box.cc and boxlist.cc

* Find out how to right adjust text in labels attached to a table (for example
    in the SpeakerEditor)

* Icons on the buttons in various dialogs

* Print less decimals in box- and speakereditor treeview, and everywhere else 
    we print decimal numbers

* Change type field in speakereditor treeview to some text instead of the 
    current integer

* Rpm, deb and tgz binary packages (important)

* Compile and run on windows (important)

* Windows installer

* Speakereditor and CrossoverHistory: ask if you want to save changes 
    when open new xml

* Loudspeaker design with GSpeakers HOWTO (important)

* All dialogs and windows should save its size and position 
    (use global settings, see common.h)

* Make id_string cell in CrossoverHistory editable

* CrossoverTreeView: add check for correct unit when the unit cell has 
    been edited

* Clear up and maybe rewrite BoxEditor

* Internationalization, get_text support and more

* Translate documentation

* Make GSpeakersPlot (gspeakersplot.h/cc) handle >20k x-values

* Optimize the order the colors appear in GSpeakersColor.cc/h (an easy task 
    but it requires some thinking), consecutive colors coming out of 
    GSpeakersColor should not be similar, the colors should also be clear and 
    easy to distinguish (<-howto spell???) from each other
