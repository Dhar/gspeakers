<h3>More information about speakerbuilding</h3>
<i>Here are some links to external websites providing more information about speakerbuilding. Please realize 
that you will find a lot of information on this topic and not much of it will be useful. 
Articles in magazines are usually much better than the stuff on the web. However, most 
articles I have read do not cover all details you want to know about. If you've got general 
questions about building loudspeakers, feel free to send me a mail (to the adress below). 
I may be able to answer your question but I cannot promise anything.<br>&nbsp;<br>
