<h1>Preparations</h1>

The first thing you have to do, before you start designing a crossover, is to type in some more driver parameters. To calculate a good filter you need <i>rdc (voice coil resistance), lvc (voice coil inductance), sensitivity, cone mass, effective radius, force factor, suspension resistance and suspension compleance</i>. You should also add a frequency response graph by clicking on the <b>Edit...</b> button, as seen in figure 1. <br>&nbsp;<br>

Then the <b>Frequency response editor</b> seen in figure 2 will pop up on your screen.<br>&nbsp;<br>

In this editor you should type in the value (in dB) the graph on the datasheet has for every frequency. Then click on <b>Save As</b> and choose a filename. When you have done this for the all the drivers we will work with you should save the driver xml by clicking on <b>Save</b> on the driver toolbar. In figure 2 you can see the frequency response for the midrange driver Seas L14RCY/P. When you click on the <b>Close</b>-button the dialog will disappear and you will see a plot of the frequency response.<br>&nbsp;<br>
