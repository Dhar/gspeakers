GSpeakers-0.8.2

* GSpeakers wont segfault when you enter a driver parameter that affects the 
    impedance response and freq resp plot is not present

* Fixed infinite loop when changing cutoff frequency for a filter

GSpeakers-0.8.1

* Fixed some minor bugs, for example some buttons didn't have any callbacks 
    connected to them

GSpeakers-0.8

* Improved the user interface a little bit more, a couple of new menu items 
    and some new toolbar buttons

* Config option "Use advanced driver impedance model" is now set per "net"

* Plot of the estimated total frequency response of a loudspeaker

* Lots of other bugfixes and improvements

GSpeakers-0.7

* Improved user interface. Moved the SpeakerEditor from dialog to separate tab.

* Lots of new icons, toolbars and menus

* Plot frequency response of a driver

GSpeakers-0.6

* You can now use an advanced model for the impedance of a driver since a 
    couple of new parameters were added to the representation of a speaker

* You can plot the summed freqeuncy response of a filter

* You can choose not to print debug information to console at configure time

* Fixes for gcc-3.2

GSpeakers-0.5

* You can now plot the frequency response of a crossover network (with the 
    help from an external SPICE interpreter)

* Lots of bugfixes, cleanups and extensions to existing code

GSpeakers-0.4

* Some bugfixes to older versions (for example, now GSpeakers
    warns you if you try to save a file to a place where 
    your user does not have write access)

* Crossover Wizard (you can calculate simple crossovers)

GSpeakers-0.3

* New UI

* Autoload files you were working with last time

* Highlight a plot in the plotwindow when a plot is selected in the plot list

GSpeakers-0.2
