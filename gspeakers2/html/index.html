<h2>About</h2>
GnomeSpeakers (short name: gspeakers) is a Gnome-based loudspeaker design 
program. It's built using the 
Gtkmm and Gnomemm libraries (C++ wrappers for the Gtk+ and Gnome libraries 
<a href="http://gtkmm.sf.net">http://gtkmm.sf.net</a>). The 
reason I started to work on this program was that I could not find any other 
Gtk/Gnome based loudspeaker design program. The question I had to ask myself was: 
How can I make it easier to design loudspeakers? I decided that GnomeSpeakers 
should implement features that makes it easy and quick to plot frequency responses 
for a lot of different speakers in a lot of different boxes. However, in the first 
version only a (pretty large) subset of these features are implemented. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42280&release_id=107067">GSpeakers-0.3 (gtkmm-2.0)</a><br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42280&release_id=106524">GSpeakers-0.2 (gtkmm-2.0)</a><br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42280&release_id=68786">GSpeakers-0.1 (gtkmm-1.2)</a><br>&nbsp;<br>

Use GSpeakers-0.4 if you want to try something new. You need libxml2 and 
a recent Gtkmm-1.3.* (I use gtkmm-1.3.22 on my system) to compile GSpeakers-0.4. Please submit any 
comments to <a href="mailto:dss@home.se">me</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h2>News</h2>
<b>2002-08-31</b>:
Released GSpeakers-0.4 today. Now you can use GSpeakers to calculate simple crossover networks. 
However, the real fun will begin in next release where you will be able to plot the frequency 
response of a filter. This will be a very powerful feature. For now, download the new version 
and play around with it. Also, take a look at the new <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>!<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-08-25</b>: 
Released GSpeakers-0.3 today. I've done a lot of work on a new GUI. Tell me what you think about it. 
I've also made some preparations for easier development down the road. Also I've inserted some 
widgets (a crossover list) that is useless in this release but it's there because I want people to 
see how i have imagined that the UI should look like. Notmally I would not do that but since I'm not 
going to promote this release heavily I decided to go for it...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-08-21</b>:
Released GSpeakers-0.2 today. Almost all code from GSpeakers-0.1 has been 
rewritten.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-01-07</b>: 
Initial public release of gspeakers-0.1 today.

<b>What about filters/crossover networks?</b><br>
This functionality will be added to the new unstable branch. See <a href="needhelp.html">
the "Help needed" section</a> for more information.
