Initial public release of gspeakers-0.1 today.

<b>About</b><br>
GnomeSpeakers (short name: gspeakers) is a Gnome-based loudspeaker design 
program. It's built using the 
Gtkmm and Gnomemm libraries (C++ wrappers for the Gtk+ and Gnome libraries 
<a href="http://gtkmm.sf.net">http://gtkmm.sf.net</a>). The 
reason I started to work on this program was that I could not find any other 
Gtk/Gnome based loudspeaker design program. The question I had to ask myself was: 
How can I make it easier to design loudspeakers? I decided that GnomeSpeakers 
should implement features that makes it easy and quick to plot frequency responses 
for a lot of different speakers in a lot of different boxes. However, in the first 
version only a (pretty large) subset of these features are implemented. 
The program is very 
modular so it is very easy to add new features. I suppose it'll only take a few 
0.x-releases before this is ready for the great version 1.0.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>What about filters/crossover networks?</b><br>
I have decided not to include a filter/crossover-designer in this program since I 
consider the filterdesigners usually included in loudspeaker design program too 
simple. I'm a fourth year electronics student who know some about filter design, 
however, not as much as i would like to know. 
I want a filter design program to be very powerful and still easy to use. 
I'll probably create a filter 
design program as a separate project. Anyone with ideas for such a program/project should 
contact me. I really need some advice on this topic and I would like to discuss
how to build GUI with someone.

<a name="history">
<b>History</b><br>
Back in 1995 (at least i think it was 95) I started a programming course in school. The 
programming language was Pascal and the operating system was MS Dos. I wanted my own 
project to work on and since I was intrested in building loudspeakers a loudspeaker 
design program was the obvious choice for a programming project. Later I got more 
intrested in GUI-programming and switched to windows. I made one version of the 
program (which I called BassCAD) for windows. The result was something that I 
called a BETA-version but you should probably call it a pre-alpha...:-) However, 
last time I touched BassCAD was almost four years ago. I would not like to see that
piece of code today. Last november it 
was time for a new project and a brand new name. GnomeSpeakers is the new project I'm 
working on. Please try it and <a href="mailto:dss@home.se">tell me</a> what 
you think about it.<br>&nbsp;<br>

Please mail me (<a href="mailto:dss@home.se">dss at home dot se</a>)what do you like
and dislike about the program. Now is 
the right time for me to make big changes to the program. If I don't get negative 
feedback I'll suppose everyone like it.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="support">
<b>Support</b><br>
The best way to get quick support on gspeakers is to send a mail to me 
(<a href="mailto:dss@home.se">dss at home dot se</a>). I'll try to answer 
questions as soon as possible. If I get a lot of mail I'll set up a 
mailinglist.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="faq">
<b>FAQ</b><br>
<i>Why does not gspeakers display any text in the plot? I also get a lot of error
messages in the console.</i><br>
You probably have gspeakers configured to use a font which does not exist on your
system. Open preferences dialog and select a font.<br>
<i>GSpeakers crashes upon startup, what is wrong?</i><br>
There might be an error in the config-file. Try "mv ~/.gspeakers ~/.gspeakers.bak" and
restart gspeakers. There might also be a problem if you specified a "pkgdatadir"
different from "[prefix]/share/gspeakers" (where [prefix] is the prefix specified when
you ran ./configure).<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Documentation</b><br>
This is a short tutorial on how to use gspeakers. The idea of the user interface 
(see screenshots) is that you store speakers and enclosures in xml-files. 
Internally the data is stored in structures but you only have to care about the 
xml-file. This is just a short walk through the toolbars. I'm not trying to teach you
how to design loudspeakers. You have to learn that elsewhere.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<img src="spktoolbar.png"><br><i>Figure 1: the speaker toolbar</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
1: Create new speaker, press this button to clear the toolbar and prepare to 
add a new speaker. Press this button if you want to add a speaker.<br>
2: Create new xml-file. Press this button if you want to start on a new set of 
speakers.<br>
3: Open xml-file. Opens a file you've created earlier or a file downloaded from 
somewhere (perhaps here later).<br>
4: Save changes you made, for example if you add a speaker, press this button to 
save that speaker to the xml-file.<br>
5: Save xml-file as...save the xml-file with a new filename.<br>
6: Remove current speaker from the toolbar.<br>
7: This is the xml-file you're working with.<br>
8: This is name of the currently selected speaker.<br>
9: Vas is a parameter for the speaker you can find in its datasheet or in most 
retailors catalouges.<br>
10: Fs is the resonanse frequency of the speaker.<br>
11: Qts is one damping-factor (i don't relly know exactely what this is)<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<img src="boxtoolbar.png"><br><i>Figure 2: the enclosure toolbar</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

1: Create new enclosure, press this button to clear the toolbar and prepare to 
add a new enclosure.<br>
2: Create new xml-file. Press this button if you want to start on a new set of 
enclosures.<br>
3: Open xml-file. Opens a file you've created earlier or a file downloaded from 
somewhere (perhaps here later).<br>
4: Save changes you made, for example if you add an enclosure, press this button to 
save that enclosure to the xml-file.<br>
5: Save xml-file as...save the xml-file with a new filename.<br>
6: Remove current enclosure from the toolbar.<br>
7: This is the xml-file you're working with.<br>
8: This is the name of the currently selected enclosure.<br>
9: Here you can select type of box, for now you can choose between two types of
boxes, ported/vented and sealed/closed box. More types will be added later but i 
want to improve the functionality of the program first.<br>
10: This is the volume (in litres) of the encolsure.<br>
11: This is the resonanse frequency of the enclosure.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>

<img src="simtoolbar.png"><br><i>Figure 3: the simulation toolbar</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
1: Create a plot of the frequncy response for the currently selected speaker in 
the currently selected enclosure.<br>
2: This will create a plot of the frequency response for the currently selected 
speaker in each of the enclsures in the enclosure toolbar. This is a powerfull 
feature that should be convenient when you want to simulate the performance for 
a lot of different speakers in a lot of different enclsures.<br>
3: The same as 2 but here you take each speaker and plot the frequency response 
for each speaker in the currently selected enclosure.<br>
4: Plot each speaker in the corresponding box. For example, if you got 3 speakers 
in the currently opened speaker xml file and 3 enclosures in the currently opened 
enclosure xml-file then this command will plot frequency response for speaker #1 in 
enclosure #1, speaker #2 in enclosure #2...<br>
5: Remove the plot you selected in the list of plots.<br>
6: Remove all plots from the greaph.<br>
7: Set enclosure volume (and for sealed enclosure the resonance frequency too) to 
the optimized volume for the currently selected speaker. The optimized volume is 
the volume that gives the speaker a flat frequency response.<br>
8: Open the properties dialog.<br>&nbsp;<br>
