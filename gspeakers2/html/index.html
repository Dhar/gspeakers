<h2>About</h2>
GnomeSpeakers (short name: gspeakers or GSpeakers) is a Gnome-based loudspeaker design 
program. It's built using the 
Gtkmm libraries (C++ wrapper for the Gtk+ libraries 
<a href="http://gtkmm.sf.net">http://gtkmm.sf.net</a>). The 
reason I started to work on this program was that I could not find any other 
Gtk/Gnome based loudspeaker design program. The question I had to ask myself was: 
How can I make it easier to design loudspeakers? You can download the result 
of my work (so far).<br>&nbsp;<br>

Use GSpeakers-0.9 if you want to try something new. You need libxml2 and 
Gtkmm-2.0.* to compile GSpeakers-0.9. Please submit any 
comments to <a href="mailto:dss@home.se">me</a>. You also need a SPICE interpreter, you can find one 
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/circuits/">here</a> or read more in 
<a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/linuxinstall.html">the installation 
instructions</a>. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<h2>News</h2>
<b>2003-01-25</b>: A long time since last release but I've added a couple of useful features since then. Initial 
gettext-support and a swedish translation was added. Other new stuff is a visual image of the components of the 
currently selected crossover network. I have also 
worked a little bit on the roadmap and I have now decided to target against a stable 1.0-release before the summer. 
However, I am sorry to say that I have dropped windows support for now since there are no precompiled gtkmm-2.0 
binaries avaliable. Download 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42280&release_id=136159">GSpeakers-0.9</a> 
and take a look at the <a href="needhelp.html">updated roadmap</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-12-20</b>: I wanted to make this program work on windows before christmas but I could not make that happen. It compiles on 
windows but the spice-part of the program does not work. However, there is enough new code in cvs to motivate a christmas release 
so here it is: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42280&release_id=129210">GSpeakers-0.8.4</a>. 
A couple of bugs were fixed and I have made a couple of nice UI tweaks. I have also 
uploaded the <a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/tutorial">tutorial</a> and updated the <a href="needhelp.html">roadmap</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-11-08</b>: Long time since the last release. No release yet but I'm working on compiling a command line spice program for windows so that next release of GSpeakers can run on windows. It compiles fine but I need some spice too...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-10-15</b>: New release (<b>GSpeakers-0.8.3</b>) which fixed a problem that occured when GSpeakers is compiled with gtkmm-1.3.24. Also a bug that caused GSpeakers to segfault the first time it was started was fixed. So if GSpeakers segfaulted when you tried to install previous versions you should download and install the new version. I am going to move to Luleå next week so I will not be able to do so much work on GSpeakers the next few weeks...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-10-09</b>: Last couple of days I spent some time writing a GSpeakers tutorial. Using your own program for real work 
is allways good and of course you will find a few bugs too. So here is a brand new bugfix release (<b>GSpeakers-0.8.2</b>). I hope 
this one wont segfault as soon as you try to use it...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-10-03</b>: A couple of critical bugs turned up in GSpeakers-0.8, some buttons were left unconnected to their callback 
functions. So, here is an update, <b>GSpeakers-0.8.1</b>. A couple of other bugfixes were also included, for example now 
gspeakers does not try to plot anything when you don't want it to. This means that it should not segfault on a fresh install 
when SPICE is not installed.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-10-01</b>: 
New release today. Time to start using silly release names. So here it is, the brand new <b>GSpeakers 0.8 (The Hollywood Life)</b>. 
Of course the release names will be related to music, a lifetime of free GSpeakers releases to the one who can guess from where 
the releases' names come from. Lots of new features, improvements and bugfixes in this release. For example, 
now you can plots the estimated frequency response of your loudspeaker system. Check out the new <a href="screenshots.html">
screenshots</a>. During the past week I've been working on a windows port of GSpeakers but it is still a week or so away... 
Expect the next release to run on windows.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-09-23</b>: 
Spent a lot of time this weekend designing icons for GSpeakers. This means that GSpeakers is a lot prettier now than 
in past releases. Make sure you check out the <a href="screenshots.html">new screenshots</a>. I've also updated the 
UI (once again) and there are a couple of other changes/bugfixes. The most important is probably the integration of the 
driver editor into the main window. Now you can use the driver tab sort of like you use a folder with datasheets. 
<a href="mailto:dss@home.se">Tell me</a> what you think about the updated UI. Please read the 
<a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/linuxinstall.html">installation instructions</a> before complaining that GSpeakers won't 
compile/install.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-09-15</b>:
Election day in Sweden. A good day to release a new version of GSpeakers (GSpeakers-0.6) to the only community where 
democracy really works and where <b>you</b> can make a huge difference. In this release you can 
use a more advanced model than a resistor to model the speaker impedance. This release also contains a plot of the 
total filter frequency response and you can remove debug output (to console) at configure time. Also this release should compile 
on gcc-3.*-systems.  
Please <a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/linuxinstall.html">
read the installtion instructions</a>. Check out the new <a href="screenshots.html">screenshot</a> and the 
<a href="needhelp.html">(once again) updated roadmap</a>. The documentation is pretty much outdated by now but please be 
patient. I will work on the doc as soon as the UI stabilizes...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-09-08</b>:
Released GSpeakers-0.5 today. In this release you can visualize the frequency response of a filter 
in a graph, similiar to the way you can simulate the frequency response of a enclosure. To do 
these simulations you need an external SPICE interpreter. Please <a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/linuxinstall.html">
read the installtion instructions</a>. Check out the new <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> and the 
<a href="needhelp.html">updated roadmap</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-08-31</b>:
Released GSpeakers-0.4 today. Now you can use GSpeakers to calculate simple crossover networks. 
However, the real fun will begin in next release where you will be able to plot the frequency 
response of a filter. This will be a very powerful feature. For now, download the new version 
and play around with it. Also, take a look at the new <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>!<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-08-25</b>: 
Released GSpeakers-0.3 today. I've done a lot of work on a new GUI. Tell me what you think about it. 
I've also made some preparations for easier development down the road. Also I've inserted some 
widgets (a crossover list) that is useless in this release but it's there because I want people to 
see how i have imagined that the UI should look like. Notmally I would not do that but since I'm not 
going to promote this release heavily I decided to go for it...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-08-21</b>:
Released GSpeakers-0.2 today. Almost all code from GSpeakers-0.1 has been 
rewritten.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-01-07</b>: 
Initial public release of gspeakers-0.1 today.
<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/gspeakers">Download</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>


<b>What about filters/crossover networks?</b><br>
This functionality will be added to the new unstable branch. See <a href="needhelp.html">
the "Help needed" section</a> for more information.
