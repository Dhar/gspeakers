<h2>About</h2>
GnomeSpeakers (short name: gspeakers) is a Gnome-based loudspeaker design 
program. It's built using the 
Gtkmm and Gnomemm libraries (C++ wrappers for the Gtk+ and Gnome libraries 
<a href="http://gtkmm.sf.net">http://gtkmm.sf.net</a>). The 
reason I started to work on this program was that I could not find any other 
Gtk/Gnome based loudspeaker design program. The question I had to ask myself was: 
How can I make it easier to design loudspeakers? You can download the result 
of my work (so far).<br>&nbsp;<br>

Use GSpeakers-0.8 if you want to try something new. You need libxml2 and 
a recent Gtkmm-1.3.* (I use gtkmm-1.3.23 on my system) to compile GSpeakers-0.8. However, if you use 
gcc-3.2 you won't be able to compile Gtkmm-1.3.23 unless you know how to fix the error you will get. Please submit any 
comments to <a href="mailto:dss@home.se">me</a>. You also need a SPICE interpreter, you can find one 
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/circuits/">here</a> or read more in 
<a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/linuxinstall.html">the installation 
instructions</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h2>News</h2>
<b>2002-09-30</b>: 
New release today. Time to start using silly release names. So here it is, the brand new <b>GSpeakers 0.8 (The Hollywood Life)</b>. 
Of course the release names are related to music... Lots of new features, improvements and bugfixes in this release. For example, 
now you can plots the estimated frequency response of your loudspeaker system. Check out new <a href="screenshots.html">
screenshots</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-09-23</b>: 
Spent a lot of time this weekend designing icons for GSpeakers. This means that GSpeakers is a lot prettier now than 
in past releases. Make sure you check out the <a href="screenshots.html">new screenshots</a>. I've also updated the 
UI (once again) and there are a couple of other changes/bugfixes. The most important is probably the integration of the 
driver editor into the main window. Now you can use the driver tab sort of like you use a folder with datasheets. 
<a href="mailto:dss@home.se">Tell me</a> what you think about the updated UI. Please read the 
<a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/linuxinstall.html">installation instructions</a> before complaining that GSpeakers won't 
compile/install.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-09-15</b>:
Election day in Sweden. A good day to release a new version of GSpeakers (GSpeakers-0.6) to the only community where 
democracy really works and where <b>you</b> can make a huge difference. In this release you can 
use a more advanced model than a resistor to model the speaker impedance. This release also contains a plot of the 
total filter frequency response and you can remove debug output (to console) at configure time. Also this release should compile 
on gcc-3.*-systems.  
Please <a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/linuxinstall.html">
read the installtion instructions</a>. Check out the new <a href="screenshots.html">screenshot</a> and the 
<a href="needhelp.html">(once again) updated roadmap</a>. The documentation is pretty much outdated by now but please be 
patient. I will work on the doc as soon as the UI stabilizes...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-09-08</b>:
Released GSpeakers-0.5 today. In this release you can visualize the frequency response of a filter 
in a graph, similiar to the way you can simulate the frequency response of a enclosure. To do 
these simulations you need an external SPICE interpreter. Please <a href="doc/gspeakers-gtk2/linuxinstall.html">
read the installtion instructions</a>. Check out the new <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> and the 
<a href="needhelp.html">updated roadmap</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-08-31</b>:
Released GSpeakers-0.4 today. Now you can use GSpeakers to calculate simple crossover networks. 
However, the real fun will begin in next release where you will be able to plot the frequency 
response of a filter. This will be a very powerful feature. For now, download the new version 
and play around with it. Also, take a look at the new <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>!<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-08-25</b>: 
Released GSpeakers-0.3 today. I've done a lot of work on a new GUI. Tell me what you think about it. 
I've also made some preparations for easier development down the road. Also I've inserted some 
widgets (a crossover list) that is useless in this release but it's there because I want people to 
see how i have imagined that the UI should look like. Notmally I would not do that but since I'm not 
going to promote this release heavily I decided to go for it...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-08-21</b>:
Released GSpeakers-0.2 today. Almost all code from GSpeakers-0.1 has been 
rewritten.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>2002-01-07</b>: 
Initial public release of gspeakers-0.1 today.
<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/gspeakers">Download</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>


<b>What about filters/crossover networks?</b><br>
This functionality will be added to the new unstable branch. See <a href="needhelp.html">
the "Help needed" section</a> for more information.
