<b>About</b><br>
GnomeSpeakers (short name: gspeakers) is a Gnome-based loudspeaker design 
program. It's built using the 
Gtkmm and Gnomemm libraries (C++ wrappers for the Gtk+ and Gnome libraries 
<a href="http://gtkmm.sf.net">http://gtkmm.sf.net</a>). The 
reason I started to work on this program was that I could not find any other 
Gtk/Gnome based loudspeaker design program. The question I had to ask myself was: 
How can I make it easier to design loudspeakers? I decided that GnomeSpeakers 
should implement features that makes it easy and quick to plot frequency responses 
for a lot of different speakers in a lot of different boxes. However, in the first 
version only a (pretty large) subset of these features are implemented. <br>&nbsp;<br>
