<h2>Help needed</h2>

Open source projects always need help!!! There's always something <b>you</b> can do to help. 
Check the 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/gspeakers/gspeakers2/TODO?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
TODO-file for the unstable GSpeakers</a> to see where to start if you 
want to help. Most issues in the TODO-file is not very difficult. The 
TODO-file contains mostly improvements to the current source tree. <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Roadmap (updated 2002-09-14)</b><br>
The roadmap contains features that will be added in future releases of GSpeakers.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.6.*:</b> Bugfix current release.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.7:</b> Improve the SpeakerEditor and move it into a separate tab. Also store the 
frequency response of a speaker and display the (free air) impedance and (optional) freq response 
in a plot (or maybe in the same plot). This tab should work as a list of datasheets of speakers.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.8:</b> A plot of the estimated freq response for the total loudspeaker (driver freq resp. + filter).
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.9:</b> Add part placement design view (only visual view, not interactive).<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.10:</b> GSpeakers should compile and run on windows (this might as well be 0.8 
or 0.10...)<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.11:</b> Not really defined yet, probably more advanced features or a first go at 
the long TODO file.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Somewhere down the road:</b> SPICE model of the impedance in an enclosure, airflow in port graph, ...

<i>If everything goes as planned I will perhaps reach GSpeakers-0.12 at the end of this year... If 
you help me we can get there even faster!!!</i>
