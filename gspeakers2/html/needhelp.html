<h2>Help needed</h2>

Open source projects always need help!!! There's always something <b>you</b> can do to help. 
Check the 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/gspeakers/gspeakers2/TODO?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
TODO-file for the unstable GSpeakers</a> to see where to start if you 
want to help. Most issues in the TODO-file is not very difficult. The 
TODO-file contains mostly improvements to the current source tree.<br>&nbsp;<br>

I have now decided to work on a stable 1.0 release of GSpeakers some time this spring. 
This will be a well tested and (hopefully) stable release suitable for packaging into 
debs and rpms. If someone create gtkmm win32 binaries there might also be a win32 
port of GSpeakers-1.0.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Roadmap (updated 2003-03-11)</b><br>
The roadmap contains features that will be added in future releases of GSpeakers.<br>
<i>Note that the version number marks features that will be implemented. They are not 
listed in the order they will be implemented.</i>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.9:</b> GSpeakers should work on locales other than the default locale. GSpeakers 
uses gettext for internationalisation. (<b>done</b>)<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.9:</b> Add part placement design view (only visual view, not interactive).(<b>done</b>)<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.10:</b> Redesign the enclosure editor tab. (<b>done</b>)<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.10.1:</b> Bugfix release (<b>done</b>)<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.11:</b> Add speaker measurement tab to main window.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.12:</b> First part of pre-1.0 TODO's<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.13:</b> Second part of pre-1.0 TODO's<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.14:</b> The tutorial is complete.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-0.15:</b> GSpeakers compiles and runs on windows (if someone creates binaries of gtkmm).
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Codefreeze</b>: from now on and until 1.0 no new features will be added<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-1.0rc1</b>: release candidate 1, bugfixes<br>&nbsp;<br>

...<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-1.0</b>: first stable release of GSpeakers<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-1.0.1</b>: the obvious bugfix release<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>GSpeakers-1.1.0</b>: the new development version of GSpeakers, will maybe one day become GSpeakers-1.2. We will use the 
same unstable/stable naming scheme like the linux kernel and the mozilla project does.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Somewhere down the road:</b> SPICE model of the impedance in an enclosure, airflow in port graph, ... 
When I can afford to by a book on this topic.<br>&nbsp;<br>
