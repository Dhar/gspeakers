<b>History</b><br>
Back in 1995 (at least i think it was 95) I started a programming course in school. The 
programming language was Pascal and the operating system was MS Dos. I wanted my own 
project to work on and since I was intrested in building loudspeakers a loudspeaker 
design program was the obvious choice for a programming project. Later I got more 
intrested in GUI-programming and switched to windows. I made one version of the 
program (which I called BassCAD) for windows. The result was something that I 
called a BETA-version but you should probably call it a pre-alpha...:-) However, 
last time I touched BassCAD was almost four years ago. I would not like to see that
piece of code today. Last november it 
was time for a new project and a brand new name. GnomeSpeakers is the new project I'm 
working on. Please try it and <a href="mailto:dss@home.se">tell me</a> what 
you think about it.<br>&nbsp;<br>

During this summer (2002) I've rewritten most of the code and created a new version of 
GSpeakers. This new version uses Gtkmm-2.0 and features an improved (at least I think so) 
user interface. I have great plans for this program and I'm sure it will turn out great...:-)
