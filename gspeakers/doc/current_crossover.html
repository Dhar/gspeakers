<h3>Howto use the current crossover window</h3>
In this window you can see the values of the different components used in the currently selected filter. You can also 
change the value of a specific component. To change the value of a component, click on the corresponding cell and it 
will become editable. To change the unit click on the unit cell. <b>Note:</b> The unit must be a valid SPICE unit, such 
as <i>m, u, n, p, k, meg...</i> (see SPICE manual for furhter information on this topic).<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h3>The fields in the table</h3>

<b>Idstring:</b> This is the identifier for a component.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Id:</b> This is the id number associated with a specific part. This is used for debugging purpose and 
will be removed in future versions of GSpeakers.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Type:</b> This is the type of component:<br>&nbsp;<br>
<table>
  <tr><td>Capacitor:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Inductor:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Resistor:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>3</td></tr>
</table><br>

<b>Value:</b> This is the part value. To edit the value, click on the cell and the value will become editable. The 
value must be a valid floating point number or else it will be set to the default value for the C++ 
istringstream operator which I think is 0.0. If the part value is set to 0.0 the program might not work properly.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Unit:</b> This is the unit which corresponds to the value. For example: if <i>value=0.2</i> and <i>unit=mH</i> 
it could also be be <i>value=200</i> and <i>unit=uH</i>. Note that unit must be a valid SPICE unit, such as 
<i>m, u, n, p, k, meg...</i> (see a SPICE manual for furhter information on this topic). To edit the unit, just 
click on the cell and it will become editable.<br>&nbsp;<br>
