<h2>The Crossover history window</h2>

This is a window where you can select which crossover you want to work with. You can also save the list and 
make backups of crossovers you have tried. This is a useful utility to  be able to quickly study differences 
between two or more crossovers.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Howto use the crossover history</h3>
By clicking on a row in the list you can select the crossover you want to work with. Use the buttons to create backups 
or new crossovers.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<h3>The fields in the table</h3>
<b>Id:</b> Id is the unique indentifier for this crossover. Don't care to much about this. Used for debugging.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Identifier:</b> A small text describing this crossover. When you create a new crossover or a copy GSpeakers will set 
this text to the current date and time.<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>Type:</b> This is the crossover type. This is a cryptic integer which can be translated to a real filter in the 
following way:<br>&nbsp;<br>
<table>
  <tr><td>Lowpass filter:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Subsonic filter:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Highpass filter:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>4</td></tr>  
  <tr><td>Twoway filter (lowpass and highpass):</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Threeway filter:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>16</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Fourway filter:</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>32</td></tr>
</table><br>
However, you can combine these numbers in a number of ways. For example, a common crossover layout today is a 2.5 way crossover which 
has two equal bass speakers and one tweeter. One of the bass speakers has a low cutoff frequency (100-1000Hz) and the 
other bass speaker takes care of the full frequency range up to the tweeter takes over. This would be represented by 
a binary OR-operation between 1 (for a lowpassfilter) and 8 (for two way filter) and you would get a resulting 9 in the 
type column for this crossover. In the screenshot all crossovers has type 8 (twoway filter).<br>&nbsp;<br>
