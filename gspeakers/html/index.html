<b>About</b><br>
GnomeSpeakers (short name: gspeakers) is a Gnome-based loudspeaker design 
program. It's built using the 
Gtkmm and Gnomemm libraries (C++ wrappers for the Gtk+ and Gnome libraries 
<a href="http://gtkmm.sf.net">http://gtkmm.sf.net</a>). The 
reason I started to work on this program was that I could not find any other 
Gtk/Gnome based loudspeaker design program. The question I had to ask myself was: 
How can I make it easier to design loudspeakers? I decided that GnomeSpeakers 
should implement features that makes it easy and quick to plot frequency responses 
for a lot of different speakers in a lot of different boxes. However, in the first 
version only a subset of these features are implemented. The program is very 
modular so it is very easy to add new features. I suppose it'll only take a few 
0.x-releases before this is ready for the great version 1.0.<br>&nbsp;<br>

I have decided to not include a filter/crossover-designer in this program. Since I 
consider the filterdesigners usually included in loudspeaker design program too 
simple (as I'm a fourth year electronics student and know some about filter design) 
I want a filter design program to be very powerful. I'll probably create a filter 
design program as a separate project. Anyone with ideas for such a program should 
contact me.<br>&nbsp;<br>
