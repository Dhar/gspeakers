<h2>General concept of lists</h2>

Often when you want to do something related to loudspeaker design you will find that you 
want to do the same thing with a number of different parts: for example electronic 
components or enclosure designs. This is why GSpeakers stores all data in list. All 
enclosures, loudspeakers and crossovers are stored in a list. When you save your work 
those lists will be written to the harddrive as xml-files. Xml enables human readable 
files but still it is easy to implement parsers for xml files in a program. However, 
libxml2, used in GSpeakers will save all data to one row in an xml file. Use the command 
'xmllint --format gspeakersfile.xml' to display the data in a more convenient way. 
Unfortunately libxml2 cannot read this much nicer formatted xml file.<br>&nbsp;<br>
