GSpeakers Redux
===============

GSpeakers Redux is an update to the GSpeakers application written by Daniel Sundberg and originally hosted at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gspeakers/).

The purpose of this update is to bring GSpeakers up to date so that it will compile without problems on modern Linuxes, to add/improve features, to encourage collaboration, and perhaps to eventually rewrite the application.  I welcome your forks and pull requests!


Original README
===============

GSpeakers is a loudspeaker enclosure and crossovernetwork designer for the gtk+/gnome desktop.

However, you can build GSpeakers on both Microsoft Windows and MacOS X. See README.win32 and README.macosx for further details.
